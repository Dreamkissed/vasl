<!--
    This file contains GpID metadata for VASL counters, specifically those whose GpID has changed over time and can
    no longer be matched by ASLGpIdChecker.

    The data here compiles known mismatches and creates a link to the new GpID which can then be used to update the counter
    during the VASL Game Updater process.

    The data here should grow over time as more mismatches are discovered and traced to source.

<!--
    FromTo metadata
	name - the name of counter being updated
	fromid - the current GpId of the counter
	toid - the name of the matchng counter in the current version of VASL and/or Extension
	addeddate - the date at which the fromtomatch element was added to this file
